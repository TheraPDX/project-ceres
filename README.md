# Project Ceres

##An automated garden prototype

Project Ceres make it possible to monitor, control and retrieve data from your indoor garden.

The prototype uses the following technologies :
* Particle Photon (formely Spark.io)
* D3.JS
* MongoDB
* Python

## To Do
* ~~Connect moisture sensor~~
* Moisture sensor calibration
* Light sensor calibration
* Temperature sensor calibration
* Add pump automatic control on server
* Design PCB
* Design case and button
* Finish data stream
* Connect data to dashboard
* Oak board drill
* Connect pump
* Add water level detection
* Buy alim
* Photos
* Social network part on website
* Buy cable sheath
* add IFTTT notifications
* Graphs code reshape 

## Questions
* Connector between photoresistro and pcb = noise ? data lost ?
* find case for photoresistor http://www.ebay.com/itm/5-IP-Camera-Photoresistor-Lead-Wire-Assy-Light-Dependent-Resistor-LDR-GL5528-B-/261513555096
* need this ? http://fr.aliexpress.com/store/product/OneWorld-Light-Intensity-Sensor-Module-5528-Photo-Resistor-For-AVR-case-for-arduino-UNO-R3/1626483_32282578300.html?storeId=1626483
* Install temperature sensor directly on pcb ?
* need better sensors ?
* Need many sample for each sensor datastream, average value seems to be sufficient => average calculation on particle or server ?
